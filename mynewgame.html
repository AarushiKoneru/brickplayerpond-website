<p>
Brick BREAKER Pong is a game coded by Aarushi using CODE.org. 
</p>

<p>The game is excatly like the og Pong BUT there is a twist! </p>

<p>The there are a wall of bricks which make the game harder and more difficult to control the TWO balls.</p>

<p>
In this game you have two players, P1 and P2(p1 is the bottom screen). 
</p>

<p>Instructions: a and d to move P2, right and left arrow keys to move p1. </p>

<p>First to 3 points wins.</p>

<p>
I hope you enjoy my game!
